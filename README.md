# Marching Squares Algorithm Visualization
A Next.js app to render a visualization of the marching squares algorithm:

The user can manipulate some variables to customize the rendering process:

Deployed to Vercel and available at: https://msquares.vercel.app/

## Planned features include:
 1. Filled field drawing (not only contours).
 2. Curved isolines.
 3. Color picker for the field, isolines, etc.
 4. Noise generation algorithms to spice up the field's random generation.
 5. New mode to animate the rendering of the filed (independently of changes on the app's global states), with the objective to render metaballs.
